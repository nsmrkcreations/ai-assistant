# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix Backend Pytest Configuration and Async Fixtures


  - Update pytest.ini configuration for proper asyncio handling
  - Fix all async fixture decorators in conftest.py to use @pytest_asyncio.fixture
  - Implement proper service initialization in fixtures to return actual service instances
  - Ensure proper async context management and cleanup
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_



- [ ] 2. Fix Service Initialization and Async Patterns
  - Review and fix service class constructors and initialization methods
  - Ensure services can be properly instantiated in test fixtures
  - Fix any async generator issues in service classes


  - Implement proper start/stop lifecycle methods for services
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 3. Fix Frontend Test Configuration and Dependencies
  - Verify Jest configuration in jest.config.js for proper test discovery


  - Check and install any missing frontend dependencies
  - Ensure TypeScript compilation works correctly for tests
  - Create basic test files if none exist to verify test runner functionality
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_




- [ ] 4. Update Test Runner and Integration Scripts
  - Fix the main test runner script to handle both backend and frontend tests properly
  - Ensure proper error handling and reporting in test execution
  - Update any integration test configurations
  - Verify test coverage reporting works correctly
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 5. Validate and Test All Fixes
  - Run the complete test suite to verify all fixes work
  - Check that no fixture-related errors remain
  - Ensure frontend tests can execute successfully
  - Verify application can start without import or dependency errors
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_
