# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Assistant Desktop Application has multiple critical issues preventing proper testing and functionality. The test suite is failing due to pytest fixture configuration problems, and the frontend tests cannot run due to missing dependencies and configuration issues. This feature addresses all identified issues to restore full functionality and testing capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all backend tests to pass without fixture-related errors, so that I can verify the application's functionality and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running backend tests THEN all pytest async fixture warnings SHALL be resolved
2. WHEN running backend tests THEN all service fixtures SHALL be properly configured with @pytest_asyncio.fixture decorator
3. WHEN running backend tests THEN all async generator fixture issues SHALL be fixed
4. WHEN running backend tests THEN the conftest.py file SHALL properly handle async service initialization

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend tests to run successfully, so that I can verify the React components and UI functionality work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running frontend tests THEN Jest SHALL find and execute all test files
2. WHEN running frontend tests THEN all required dependencies SHALL be available
3. WHEN running frontend tests THEN the test configuration SHALL be properly set up
4. WHEN running frontend tests THEN TypeScript compilation SHALL work correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all import and dependency issues resolved, so that the application can start and run without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the application THEN all Python imports SHALL resolve correctly
2. WHEN starting the application THEN all service dependencies SHALL be properly initialized
3. WHEN starting the application THEN no missing module errors SHALL occur
4. WHEN starting the application THEN all configuration files SHALL be valid

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test runner to execute both backend and frontend tests successfully, so that I can verify the entire application works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the test runner THEN backend tests SHALL complete without fixture errors
2. WHEN running the test runner THEN frontend tests SHALL execute successfully
3. WHEN running the test runner THEN test coverage reports SHALL be generated
4. WHEN running the test runner THEN the exit code SHALL be 0 for successful tests

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all service initialization issues fixed, so that the application services can start and communicate properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing services THEN all async service constructors SHALL work correctly
2. WHEN initializing services THEN service dependencies SHALL be properly injected
3. WHEN initializing services THEN configuration SHALL be properly loaded
4. WHEN initializing services THEN no AttributeError exceptions SHALL occur
