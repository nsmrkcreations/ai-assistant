# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Assistant Desktop Application has 16 specific test failures that need to be resolved to achieve 100% test pass rate. These failures are primarily related to GUI automation expectations in test environments, mock configuration issues, and test assertion logic problems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all automation service tests to pass in test environments, so that I can verify automation functionality works correctly without requiring actual GUI libraries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running automation tests THEN GUI automation failures SHALL be properly mocked for test environments
2. WHEN GUI libraries are not available THEN tests SHALL use mock implementations instead of failing
3. WHEN testing task cancellation THEN the test SHALL properly simulate async task cancellation
4. WHEN testing automation tasks THEN the test SHALL expect appropriate status based on environment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all LLM service tests to pass, so that I can verify the language model integration works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing LLM service startup THEN mocked Ollama responses SHALL be properly configured
2. WHEN testing automation command parsing THEN invalid commands SHALL return proper empty results
3. WHEN testing model availability THEN mock HTTP clients SHALL be properly configured
4. WHEN testing service status THEN proper mock responses SHALL be returned

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all security service tests to pass, so that I can verify security functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing encryption initialization THEN file permission issues SHALL be handled gracefully
2. WHEN testing security events THEN event ordering and limits SHALL be properly managed
3. WHEN testing encryption without cipher THEN proper exceptions SHALL be raised
4. WHEN testing security event retrieval THEN proper event ordering SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance tests to pass consistently, so that I can verify system performance meets requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing response time consistency THEN variance thresholds SHALL account for test environment variability
2. WHEN measuring performance THEN tests SHALL use appropriate tolerances for CI environments
3. WHEN testing concurrent operations THEN proper synchronization SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN measuring timing THEN tests SHALL account for system load variations
