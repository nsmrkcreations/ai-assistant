# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Assistant Desktop Application is a comprehensive personal AI assistant that operates as a standalone desktop application. It acts as an AI employee capable of voice and text interaction, autonomous task execution, application control, self-healing, and continuous learning from user behavior. The assistant runs persistently in the background, providing proactive guidance and completing full end-to-end workflows across various applications and platforms.

### Requirement 2: Application Control and Automation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the assistant to control applications on my computer, so that I can automate workflows and complete complex tasks hands-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests to open an application THEN the system SHALL launch the specified application
2. WHEN a user requests document creation THEN the system SHALL create documents in the appropriate application
3. WHEN a user requests browser automation THEN the system SHALL use Playwright to control web browsers
4. WHEN a user requests desktop automation THEN the system SHALL use PyAutoGUI for GUI interactions
5. WHEN a user requests Adobe Animate tasks THEN the system SHALL execute JSFL scripts for automation
6. WHEN a user requests Cartoon Animator 5 tasks THEN the system SHALL execute appropriate automation scripts

### Requirement 3: Always-On Background Operation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the assistant to run automatically when my computer starts and stay available in the background, so that I can access help whenever needed without manual startup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system boots THEN the assistant SHALL start automatically via OS startup services
2. WHEN running in background THEN the system SHALL display a tray icon for quick access
3. WHEN the assistant is running THEN the system SHALL listen for hotword activation or manual triggers
4. WHEN monitoring user activity THEN the system SHALL observe application usage patterns
5. WHEN detecting inefficient workflows THEN the system SHALL provide proactive suggestions

### Requirement 4: Self-Healing and Autonomous Upgrades

**User Story:** As a user, I want the assistant to automatically fix issues and update itself, so that I don't need to manually maintain the software.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component fails THEN the system SHALL auto-diagnose the issue using log analysis
2. WHEN a known issue is detected THEN the system SHALL execute self-repair scripts automatically
3. WHEN updates are available THEN the system SHALL download and install them autonomously
4. WHEN self-repair fails THEN the system SHALL log the issue and suggest manual intervention
5. WHEN demonstrating capabilities THEN the system SHALL show self-healing and upgrade processes in demo mode

### Requirement 5: Personalized Learning and Adaptation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the assistant to learn from my daily activities and preferences, so that it becomes more helpful and personalized over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN observing user workflows THEN the system SHALL store patterns in a local vector database
2. WHEN detecting repetitive tasks THEN the system SHALL suggest automation opportunities
3. WHEN user approves automation THEN the system SHALL create and integrate custom macros/scripts
4. WHEN sufficient data is collected THEN the system SHALL optionally fine-tune local models
5. WHEN storing personal data THEN the system SHALL encrypt all information locally

### Requirement 6: Complete End-to-End Task Execution

**User Story:** As a user, I want the assistant to complete full workflows from start to finish, so that I don't need to handle partial results or intermediate steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN given a complex task THEN the system SHALL break it down into executable steps
2. WHEN executing workflows THEN the system SHALL complete all steps without user intervention
3. WHEN creating content THEN the system SHALL generate all required assets (text, images, audio)
4. WHEN missing information THEN the system SHALL research and gather data from web sources
5. WHEN tasks involve multiple applications THEN the system SHALL coordinate between them seamlessly

### Requirement 7: Security and Privacy Protection

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data and system to be secure from unauthorized access, so that my privacy is protected and the assistant cannot be compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL encrypt all local storage using AES-256
2. WHEN communicating over network THEN the system SHALL use TLS 1.3 encryption
3. WHEN accessing sensitive applications THEN the system SHALL request explicit user permissions
4. WHEN executing scripts THEN the system SHALL run them in sandboxed environments
5. WHEN detecting tampering THEN the system SHALL trigger auto-repair mechanisms
6. WHEN storing personal learning data THEN the system SHALL allow user deletion at any time

### Requirement 8: Cross-Platform Installation and Deployment

**User Story:** As a user, I want to install the assistant easily on any supported operating system, so that I can use it regardless of my platform choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing on Windows THEN the system SHALL provide a single .exe installer
2. WHEN installing on macOS THEN the system SHALL provide a .dmg installer package
3. WHEN installing on Linux THEN the system SHALL provide AppImage or .deb packages
4. WHEN checking system requirements THEN the installer SHALL verify RAM, CPU, GPU, and disk space
5. WHEN requirements are unmet THEN the installer SHALL prevent installation and show requirements
6. WHEN installation completes THEN the system SHALL register auto-start services and create shortcuts

### Requirement 9: Demonstration and Onboarding

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to see what the assistant can do through an interactive demo, so that I understand its capabilities and feel confident using it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN first launching THEN the system SHALL start with a voice and text greeting
2. WHEN in demo mode THEN the system SHALL demonstrate 2-3 sample tasks automatically
3. WHEN showing self-healing THEN the system SHALL simulate and fix a missing dependency
4. WHEN showing auto-upgrade THEN the system SHALL demonstrate updating a bundled model
5. WHEN demo completes THEN the system SHALL switch to normal assistant mode

### Requirement 10: Asset Generation and Creative Tasks
